## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What is compareMS2?

compareMS2 is a tool for direct comparison of tandem mass spectrometry datasets, typically from liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), defining similarity as a function of shared (similar) spectra and distance as the inverse of this similarity. Data with identical spectral content thus have similarity 1 and distance 0. The similarity of datasets with no similar spectra tend to 0 (distance +âˆž) as the size of the sets go to infinity. The extremes of none or all spectra being similar between two LC-MS/MS datasets are unlikely to occur in reality.

### 1.2 How does compareMS2 differ from other tools?

Though compareMS2 is not limited to tandem mass spectra of peptides, it has seen most application to this type of data. There are four broad categories of tools for the analysis of peptide tandem mass spectra in mass spectrometry-based proteomics based on what prior information they utilize. compareMS2 belongs to a class of tools that do not use existing sequence data or libraries of spectra assigned to a specific peptide sequence, but compare tandem mass spectra directly with other tandem mass spectra:

### 1.3 What can compareMS2 be used for?

compareMS2 (and similar tools) have extremely broad utility, but have so far seen most utility in data quality control, food/feed species identification and molecular phylogenetics. Molecular phylogenetics is the study of evolution and relatedness of organisms, genes or proteins. The field dates back to [1960](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.46.10.1349) using patterns of tryptic peptides separated by paper chromatography. compareMS2 is a [21st-century analogue](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00528), comparing patterns of tryptic peptides as analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry, with the difference that it can use thousands of peptides and that the tandem mass spectra are highly peptide-specific.

However, not only the amino acid sequences of the peptides affect the distance metric in compareMS2, but also the abundance (or coverage) of the proteins. compareMS2 can also be used to quantify the similarity of proteomes from different cell lines or tissues from the same species, before and independently of any protein identification by database or spectral library search.

## 3. Using compareMS2

This section describes how to run the compareMS2 command line software. Every compareMS2 analysis consists of two phases: (1) pairwise comparison of all LC-MS/MS datasets and (2) calculating a distance matrix from all pairwise comparisons. The pairwise comparison of the datasets provides a measure of their similarity. The distance matrix can then be used for molecular phylogenetics, data quality control or other purposes.

### 3.1 Configuring compareMS2  

The compareMS2 CLI has a small number of parameters, which are:

-A *first dataset filename*  
-B *second dataset filename*
-W *first scan number*, *last scan number*  
-R *first retention time*, *last retention time*  
-c *cutoff for spectral similarity*  
-o *output filename*  
-m *minimum base peak intensity*, *minimum total MS/MS intensity*  
-w *maximum scan number difference*  
-r *maximum retention time difference*  
-p *maximum difference in precursor mass*  
-e *maximum precursor mass measurement error*  
-s *intensity scaling before dot product*  
-n *noise threshold for dot product*  
-d *version of set distance metric*  
-q *version of QC metric*  
-N *include only N most intense spectra in comparison*  
-b *bin size for dot product*  
-I *minimum number of peaks for dot product*  
-L *lower m/z for dot product*  
-U *upper m/z for dot product*  
-x *experimental features*  

The compareMS2 GUI exposes some of these, and determine others automatically, e.g. the dataset filenames from a specified directory.

### 3.2 Calculating distance matrices

Distance matrices are calculated using a separate executable, compareMS2_to_distance_matrices. This can also average the distances for multiple replicates per species for more accurate molecular phylogenetic analysis. For this, a tab-delimited file with filenames and species names are required. If no such file is provided, one is created automatically, using the filenames as sample "species". The distance matrix can currently be saved in the MEGA or Nexus formats. [MEGA](https://www.megasoftware.net/) is recommended for creating trees from compareMS2 results.

### 3.3 Running compareMS2

### 3.4 Molecular phylogenetics

We recommend [MEGA](https://www.megasoftware.net/) creating phylogenetic trees from compareMS2 results. However, most phylogenetic software can take distance matrices as input for UPGMA analysis. This was the original use for which compareMS2 was developed, see the [2012 paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.6162).

### 3.6 Experimental features

Starting in version 2.0, we have begun to include experimental features in compareMS2. These are only available on the command line, but allow extraction of additional information from the comparisons, such as the distribution of similarity between tandem mass spectra as function of precursor mass measurement error, allowing identification of isotope errors and charge state distributions *before* any database search:

![Experimental feature](./pictures/experimental_features.png)  
Figure 2. Similarity (spectral angle from 0 to 1) of tandem mass spectra plotted against precursor *m*/*z* difference, revealing isotope errors up to at least 2 (corresponding to bands at *m*/*z* difference 2/3 and 2/5) and charge states up to 6 (corresponding to the band at *m*/*z* difference 1/6).
