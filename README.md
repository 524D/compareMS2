## Introduction

### What is compareMS2?

compareMS2 is a tool for direct comparison of tandem mass spectrometry datasets, defining similarity as a function of shared (similar) spectra and distance as the inverse of this similarity. Data with identical spectral content thus have similarity 1 and distance 0. Data with no similar spectra have similarity 0 and distance +âˆž. These extremes are unlikely to occur in practise, however.

### How does compareMS2 differ from other tools?
Though compareMS2 is not limited to tandem mass spectra of peptides, it has seen most application to this type of data. There are four broad categories of tools for the analysis of peptide tandem mass spectra in mass spectrometry-based proteomics based on what prior information they utilize. compareMS2 belongs to a class of tools that do not use existing sequence data, but compare tandem mass spectra directly with other tandem mass spectra.

## Installing compareMS2

Install nodejs:

* On Linux `apt install nodejs`
* On windows download from: <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>

From the command prompt:

```text
npm install -g electron-forge
git clone https://github.com/524D/compareMS2
cd compareMS2
npm install
```

## Run in development mode

```text
electron-forge start
```

## Building

To build a distributable package (for the platform where this command is executed from):

```text
electron-forge make
```

The resulting installer can than be found (relative to the compareMS2 main directory) in:
`out\make\squirrel.windows\x64\compareMS2-x.y.z Setup.exe` for windows.
